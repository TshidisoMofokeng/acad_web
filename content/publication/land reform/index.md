abstract: Land reform is a crucial component of South Africa’s economic strategy if it is to remedy past injustices and realise a future of inclusive economic growth and social stability. This paper provides a comprehensive study of the Land Reform Policy of South Africa, starting with an exploration of the historical and socio-economic context. In particular, we discuss the three pillars of land reform and the progression of the laws that led to the Land Reform Policy that exists today. We discuss the aspects of the policy’s effectiveness, drawing on the strengths and weaknesses of the policy, as well as the unintended consequences that have arisen. We propose alternative solutions and improvements for the policy, deduced from the analysis of several case studies and insights from other countries. Opposing views are also put forward, providing a well-rounded argument and allowing for the different perspectives of all stakeholders to be considered in the study. We find that the Policy has the potential to be extremely effective if those in power will take heed of the recommendations and improvements that may be vital in propelling the Policy to reach its targets.
