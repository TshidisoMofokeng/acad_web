abstract: Power relationships between the king, military, and political parties define Thailand’s political landscape. Even though democracy has made small strides, the military continues to have a big influence, which limits the impact of political parties. Due to the economy’s substantial reliance on tourism, which was negatively hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, structural inefficiencies have been highlighted which consequently reflect in the economy’s sluggish growth. Although inflation rates have remained stable, events like oil price shocks and geopolitical unrest might also hinder economic growth. Effective debt management solutions are required because rising public debt raises questions about the sustainability of the economy. Long-term hazards posed by cyber security attacks highlight the need for better data security procedures. Political reforms, economic diversification, responsible fiscal management, and improved cyber security and national security capabilities are all necessary to address these issues.
