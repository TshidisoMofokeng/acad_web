This paper investigates contemporary macroeconomics by developing a decentralized dynamic general equilibrium model in MATLAB using Dynare. It focuses on micro-founded technique for
modeling real-world business cycles and addresses constraints to understanding and predict economic phenomena. The paper further builds a benchmark DGE model, incorporating a utility
function with two state variables, and presents Impulse Response Functions in linearised and log-linearised forms. This offers insights into economic implications of a shock to technology on various
macroeconomic variables. The findings were that output, consumption, investment, labour, the
rental rate of capital and wages increased in response to a 1% shock in technology. Whereas, the
marginal utility of consumption and leisure subsided in response to a 1% shock in technology.
